The bar chart and line make it very easy to differentiate the two different variables being measured. The graph is a better way to create this relationship because it shows that by kingdom there is one that does much better than the others.  Along with correlation it shows change over time as well because it includes the academic year."

Also hovering above the dots allows you to see the animals class which can be used to compare how they fare against one another. From the averages you can get range , see outliers, get IQR amongst many other useful numbers. This is why distribution graphs are helpful."

Also what can be seen is not many others have had such drastic changes in their trends unlike Mammalia. The cause of this could be a very large number of Mammalia mascots in the league. Overall no other tax class could take the lead over the Mammalia."
